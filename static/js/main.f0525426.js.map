A type is a set of values. Boolean, for example, is the type comprising\n\t//. `true` and `false`. A value may be a member of multiple types (`42` is a\n\t//. member of Number, PositiveNumber, Integer, and many other types).\n\t//.\n\t//. In certain situations it is useful to divide JavaScript values into\n\t//. non-overlapping types. The language provides two constructs for this\n\t//. purpose: the [`typeof`][1] operator and [`Object.prototype.toString`][2].\n\t//. Each has pros and cons, but neither supports user-defined types.\n\t//.\n\t//. This package specifies an [algorithm][3] for deriving a _type identifier_\n\t//. from any JavaScript value, and exports an implementation of the algorithm.\n\t//. Authors of algebraic data types may follow this specification in order to\n\t//. make their data types compatible with the algorithm.\n\t//.\n\t//. ### Algorithm\n\t//.\n\t//. 1.  Take any JavaScript value `x`.\n\t//.\n\t//. 2.  If `x` is `null` or `undefined`, go to step 6.\n\t//.\n\t//. 3.  If `x.constructor` evaluates to `null` or `undefined`, go to step 6.\n\t//.\n\t//. 4.  If `x.constructor.prototype === x`, go to step 6. This check prevents a\n\t//.     prototype object from being considered a member of its associated type.\n\t//.\n\t//. 5.  If `typeof x.constructor['@@type']` evaluates to `'string'`, return\n\t//.     the value of `x.constructor['@@type']`.\n\t//.\n\t//. 6.  Return the [`Object.prototype.toString`][2] representation of `x`\n\t//.     without the leading `'[object '` and trailing `']'`.\n\t//.\n\t//. ### Compatibility\n\t//.\n\t//. For an algebraic data type to be compatible with the [algorithm][3]:\n\t//.\n\t//.   - every member of the type must have a `constructor` property pointing\n\t//.     to an object known as the _type representative_;\n\t//.\n\t//.   - the type representative must have a `@@type` property; and\n\t//.\n\t//.   - the type representative's `@@type` property (the _type identifier_)\n\t//.     must be a string primitive, ideally `'<npm-package-name>/<type-name>'`.\n\t//.\n\t//. For example:\n\t//.\n\t//. ```javascript\n\t//. //  Identity :: a -> Identity a\n\t//. function Identity(x) {\n\t//.   if (!(this instanceof Identity)) return new Identity(x);\n\t//.   this.value = x;\n\t//. }\n\t//.\n\t//. Identity['@@type'] = 'my-package/Identity';\n\t//. ```\n\t//.\n\t//. Note that by using a constructor function the `constructor` property is set\n\t//. implicitly for each value created. Constructor functions are convenient for\n\t//. this reason, but are not required. This definition is also valid:\n\t//.\n\t//. ```javascript\n\t//. //  IdentityTypeRep :: TypeRep Identity\n\t//. var IdentityTypeRep = {\n\t//.   '@@type': 'my-package/Identity'\n\t//. };\n\t//.\n\t//. //  Identity :: a -> Identity a\n\t//. function Identity(x) {\n\t//.   return {constructor: IdentityTypeRep, value: x};\n\t//. }\n\t//. ```\n\t//.\n\t//. ### Usage\n\t//.\n\t//. ```javascript\n\t//. var Identity = require('my-package').Identity;\n\t//. var type = require('sanctuary-type-identifiers');\n\t//.\n\t//. type(null);         // => 'Null'\n\t//. type(true);         // => 'Boolean'\n\t//. type([1, 2, 3]);    // => 'Array'\n\t//. type(Identity);     // => 'Function'\n\t//. type(Identity(0));  // => 'my-package/Identity'\n\t//. ```\n\t//.\n\t//.\n\t//.

Take any JavaScript value `x`.\n//.\n//. 2.  If `x` is `null` or `undefined`, go to step 6.\n//.\n//. 3.  If `x.constructor` evaluates to `null` or `undefined`, go to step 6.\n//.\n//. 4.  If `x.constructor.prototype === x`, go to step 6. This check prevents a\n//.     prototype object from being considered a member of its associated type.\n//.\n//. 5.  If `typeof x.constructor['@@type']` evaluates to `'string'`, return\n//.     the value of `x.constructor['@@type']`.\n//.\n//. 6.  Return the [`Object.prototype.toString`][2] representation of `x`\n//.     without the leading `'[object '` and trailing `']'`.\n//.\n//. ### Compatibility\n//.\n//. For an algebraic data type to be compatible with the [algorithm][3]:\n//.\n//.   - every member of the type must have a `constructor` property pointing\n//.     to an object known as the _type representative_;\n//.\n//.   - the type representative must have a `@@type` property; and\n//.\n//.   - the type representative's `@@type` property (the _type identifier_)\n//.     must be a string primitive, ideally `'<npm-package-name>/<type-name>'`.\n//.\n//. For example:\n//.\n//. ```javascript\n//. //  Identity :: a -> Identity a\n//. function Identity(x) {\n//.   if (!(this instanceof Identity)) return new Identity(x);\n//.   this.value = x;\n//. }\n//.\n//. Identity['@@type'] = 'my-package/Identity';\n//. ```\n//.\n//. Note that by using a constructor function the `constructor` property is set\n//. implicitly for each value created. Constructor functions are convenient for\n//. this reason, but are not required. This definition is also valid:\n//.\n//. ```javascript\n//. //  IdentityTypeRep :: TypeRep Identity\n//. var IdentityTypeRep = {\n//.   '@@type': 'my-package/Identity'\n//. };\n//.\n//. //  Identity :: a -> Identity a\n//. function Identity(x) {\n//.   return {constructor: IdentityTypeRep, value: x};\n//. }\n//. ```\n//.\n//. ### Usage\n//.\n//. ```javascript\n//. var Identity = require('my-package').Identity;\n//. var type = require('sanctuary-type-identifiers');\n//.\n//. type(null);         // => 'Null'\n//. type(true);         // => 'Boolean'\n//. type([1, 2, 3]);    // => 'Array'\n//. type(Identity);     // => 'Function'\n//. type(Identity(0));  // => 'my-package/Identity'\n//. ```\n//.\n//.\n//.

This project provides:\n//.\n//.   - [`TypeClass`](#TypeClass), a function for defining type classes;\n//.   - one `TypeClass` value for each Fantasy Land type class;\n//.   - lawful Fantasy Land methods for JavaScript's built-in types;\n//.   - one function for each Fantasy Land method; and\n//.   - several functions derived from these functions.\n//.\n//. ## Type-class hierarchy\n//.\n//. <pre>\n//:  Setoid   Semigroup   Foldable        Functor      Contravariant\n//: (equals)   (concat)   (reduce)         (map)        (contramap)\n//:               |           \\         / | | | | \\\n//:               |            \\       /  | | | |  \\\n//:               |             \\     /   | | | |   \\\n//:               |              \\   /    | | | |    \\\n//:               |               \\ /     | | | |     \\\n//:            Monoid         Traversable | | | |      \\\n//:            (empty)        (traverse)  / | | \\       \\\n//:                                      /  | |  \\       \\\n//:                                     /   / \\   \\       \\\n//:                             Profunctor /   \\ Bifunctor \\\n//:                              (promap) /     \\ (bimap)   \\\n//:                                      /       \\           \\\n//:                                     /         \\           \\\n//:                                   Alt        Apply      Extend\n//:                                  (alt)        (ap)     (extend)\n//:                                   /           / \\           \\\n//:                                  /           /   \\           \\\n//:                                 /           /     \\           \\\n//:                                /           /       \\           \\\n//:                               /           /         \\           \\\n//:                             Plus    Applicative    Chain      Comonad\n//:                            (zero)       (of)      (chain)    (extract)\n//:                               \\         / \\         / \\\n//:                                \\       /   \\       /   \\\n//:                                 \\     /     \\     /     \\\n//:                                  \\   /       \\   /       \\\n//:                                   \\ /         \\ /         \\\n//:                               Alternative    Monad     ChainRec\n//:                                                       (chainRec)\n//. </pre>\n//.\n//. ## API\n\n(function(f) {\n\n  'use strict';\n\n  /* istanbul ignore else */\n  if (typeof module === 'object' && typeof module.exports === 'object') {\n    module.exports = f(require('sanctuary-type-identifiers'));\n  } else if (typeof define === 'function' && define.amd != null) {\n    define(['sanctuary-type-identifiers'], f);\n  } else {\n    self.sanctuaryTypeClasses = f(self.sanctuaryTypeIdentifiers);\n  }\n\n}(function(type) {\n\n  'use strict';\n\n  //  concat_ :: Array a -> Array a -> Array a\n  function concat_(xs) {\n    return function(ys) {\n      return xs.concat(ys);\n    };\n  }\n\n  //  constant :: a -> b -> a\n  function constant(x) {\n    return function(y) {\n      return x;\n    };\n  }\n\n  //  has :: (String, Object) -> Boolean\n  function has(k, o) {\n    return Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(o, k);\n  }\n\n  //  identity :: a -> a\n  function identity(x) { return x; }\n\n  //  pair :: a -> b -> Pair a b\n  function pair(x) {\n    return function(y) {\n      return [x, y];\n    };\n  }\n\n  //  type Iteration a = { value :: a, done :: Boolean }\n\n  //  iterationNext :: a -> Iteration a\n  function iterationNext(x) { return {value: x, done: false}; }\n\n  //  iterationDone :: a -> Iteration a\n  function iterationDone(x) { return {value: x, done: true}; }\n\n  //# TypeClass :: (String, Array TypeClass, a -> Boolean) -> TypeClass\n  //.\n  //.
